# pyAtmosThermo
Library to calculate atmospheric moist thermodynamic quantities.

This is a piece of code I wrote during my Ph.D. to calculate moist thermodynamic atmospheric quantities in Python. Examples include routines to calculate equivalent potential temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, moist static energy. Requires numpy but is otherwise pure python. 

Functions are mostly documented here on [https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyatmosthermo/en/latest](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyatmosthermo/en/latest), but not in great detail. If in doubt, consult the code.

Installing this package is relatively easy with pip. Just execute 

``` bash
pip install git+git://github.com/r-shekhar/pyAtmosThermo.git
```

If you have questions or find bugs with the calculation code, please file an
issue in the github tracker or email me at ravi dot shekhar at gmail dot com.
