# pyAtmosThermo
Library to calculate atmospheric moist dynamic and thermodynamic quantities.

This is a piece of code I wrote during my Ph.D. to calculate moist thermodynamic atmospheric quantities in Python. Examples include routines to calculate equivalent potential temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, moist static energy. Requires numpy but is otherwise pure python.
